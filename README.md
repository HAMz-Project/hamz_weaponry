### Weaponry - Realistic Gunplay (for ox_inventory)

Description
This script called weaponry is a melting pot of multiple functions such as :

    No reticle - Disable the aiming reticle to make it harder to aim
    Enable/disable ammo HUD - You better count the ammo number you shoot because itâ€™s not writen anymore !
    Visual recoil - By adding a shakycam while you shoot it gets more realistic !
    Effective recoil - All credit goes to Blumlaut with his recoil script 5.3k
    No melee - Disable melee with weapon (except melee ones) to avoid killing mates while reloading or shooting. Thanks to AdrineX.
    Hide HUD component
